### 🐎 About Me

I came all the way from **Hokkaido** to join the Tracen Academy (and GitHub)! I might get a little nervous before a big release, but I promise to always run full speed ahead! 

* **Trainer-san:** You! (Thank you for guiding me!)
* **Dream:** To be the number one horse girl developer in Japan!
* **Favorite Activity:** Coding... and EATING! 🍚 (Especially carrots and mom's cooking!)
* **Weakness:** I sometimes get distracted by delicious food smells...
* **Codemate:** @MejiroDober (I admire her clean code so much!)
